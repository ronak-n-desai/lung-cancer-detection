One of the most important applications of deep neural networks in the healthcare inducstry is the classification of various types of diseases from image data. Particularly, one life-saving application is to detect cancerous cells at an early stage. In this project, we will train convolutional neural networks with a dataset of 25,000 images to distinguish normal lung tissues from cancerous ones.

[Here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lung-cancer-detection-using-convolutional-neural-network-cnn/#) is an article that describes the dataset and gives a basic approach to training the model with around 91 percent accuracy on a validation data set. Can we develop a model that can achieve higher accuracies? We explore various different architectures and several advanced CNN models and report our findings. Additionally, we compare these methods to our simple base-line model which had around 89 percent accuracy on the validation set to gain a better understanding of which modifications influence the accuracy the most.
